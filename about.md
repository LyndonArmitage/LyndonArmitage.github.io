<p class="message">
This website was set up after not renewing the domain lyndonarmitage.com which 
had previously been bought by domain squatters, it now redirects to 
[lyndon.codes](https://lyndon.codes).
</p>

The main purpose of this site is to showcase various pieces of technical 
knowledge and things I (Lyndon Armitage) find interesting.

## Work

My primary experience is with developing Java/JVM based Big Data solutions.

I am currently employed as a Full Stack Developer at 
[Synoptic Technologies Ltd](https://www.synoptica.com/) based in Guildford, UK. 
Where I work primarily on the back-end of their AI technologies that power 
their platform Synoptica; using technologies including Apache Spark, Spring, 
Elasticsearch, Eclipse Vert.x, Apache NiFi, Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, 
PostgreSQL, and many more.

I Previously worked at BAE Systems Applied Intelligence (formally Detica) 
on various projects involving Big Data technologies such as Hadoop, 
Apache Spark, Apache NiFi, Apache Kafka, Elasticsearch, MySQL, as well as 
several in-house tools and storage solutions.

Previous to BAE I worked at a small software company called 
[IDR Solutions](https://www.idrsolutions.com/) who specialise in Java and Web 
based PDF solutions. There I primarily used Java, JavaScript and HTML5 with 
some exposure to application servers such as GlassFish.

## Website Source

This website is built upon the static site generator Jeykll and the theme 
[Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) which is a project based on the
[Poole](https://github.com/poole) example theme.

After having used Wordpress in the past for my original blog I opted for 
something different which should hopefully be simpler to maintain and add 
content to.

The source code to this site is currently maintained on GitHub at: 
https://github.com/LyndonArmitage/lyndonarmitage.github.io
