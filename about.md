<p class="message">
This website was set up after not renewing the domain lyndonarmitage.com which 
has since been bought by who I assume to be domain squatters.
</p>

The main purpose of this site is to showcase various pieces of technical 
knowledge and things I (Lyndon Armitage) find interesting.

This website is built upon the static site generator Jeykll and the theme 
[Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) which is a project based on the
[Poole](https://github.com/poole) example theme.
After having used Wordpress in the past for my original blog I opted for 
something different which should hopefully be simpler to maintain and add 
content to.
