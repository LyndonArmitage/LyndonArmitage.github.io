This is the source to my website [lyndon.codes](http://lyndon.codes)

It is built using Jekyll and Poole.


## Running Locally

Make sure you have ruby 2.4+ installed along with gem 2.4+.

See: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
bundle install
```

Then you can run locally using:

`bundle exec jekyll serve` or `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch` to see changes 
live.

On Ubuntu you may need to update Ruby using a ppa: https://askubuntu.com/a/839782
May need to run `update-alternatives --config ruby` if you have an older Ruby 
installed.
