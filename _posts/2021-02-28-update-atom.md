title: Update Atom.xml
layout: post
tags: [blog, atom, rss]

This morning I updated my [atom.xml]({{ site.url }}/atom.xml) to include a
summary and a few more details that were missing from it.

After asking on [fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/web/statuses/105808715464947305)
I decided to keep the full blog article content inside the feed.  
I mostly use plain markdown for my blog posts so the HTML that is rendered here
on this page is kept pretty simple and RSS feed friendly, I do occasionally use
more complex graphics and tables but even then that should be parsable by any
halfway decent HTML parser (I even try to stick to old XHTML style tags because
out of old habits).

I am also considering adding a mirror of my blog to the
[Gemini protocol](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) but am unsure on the best
way to proceed since I use the Liquid templating language in Jekyll.
