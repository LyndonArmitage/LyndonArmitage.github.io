After some deliberation, I have decided to create a new blog to maintain some
presence online.

I opted to use the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and 
[Poole](http://getpoole.com/) (specifically it's 
[Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme) to create a simple static site.

It's my hope that I can write occasional posts on various technical subjects 
I find interesting.
